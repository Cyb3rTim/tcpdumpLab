## 📘 Overview

This lab demonstrates the use of `tcpdump`, a powerful command-line packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting and security analysis. Through a series of hands-on tasks, we explore how to filter, read, and interpret packet capture (PCAP) files using `tcpdump` and Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF).

---

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

- Understand the basic and advanced `tcpdump` flags.
- Use BPF syntax to filter specific traffic from packet captures.
- Analyze raw packet data in human-readable formats.
- Apply practical CLI techniques for forensic traffic analysis.

---

## ✍🏽 Languages Used

- Linux 

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Concepts 

- `tcpdump` CLI utility
- PCAP files (`investigate.pcap`, `session.pcap`)
- Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF)
- Hexdump output
- Packet dissection and field interpretation

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- `tcpdump` is a lightweight, flexible tool ideal for quick network forensics.
- BPF syntax enables deep, precise filtering of traffic for investigation.
- CLI chaining improves speed and efficiency in packet analysis.
- Understanding packet structure and headers is vital for intrusion detection and response.
- Hands-on practice with tools like `tcpdump` helps bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.
